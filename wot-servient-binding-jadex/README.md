This module uses [Jadex](https://www.activecomponents.org/#/project/news) to connect distributed nodes running the WoT
implementation.

Jadex built-in discovery function is used. In addition, Jadex allows interaction of nodes that do not have a direct
connection (e.g. nodes behind NAT).

## Examples

Examples can be found in the `city.sane.wot.examples` package.
